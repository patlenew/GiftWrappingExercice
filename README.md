# GiftWrappingExercice
 
A small algorithm exercice for run: a roughly-made gift wrapping algorithm inspired by watching The Coding Train channel but in C#.
It uses line renderers and an XZ range for instanciating the nodes. To test, you simply have to click on the "Convex Hull XZ" Component
and click on the generate nodes in game mode.
